# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral:This laptop has a very nice design with the silver/chrome body and backlight keyboard that makes it astetically apleasing. The laptop comes to life after the power buttion is illuminated and lights start to appear on the screen.

* Behavioral:Behavioral design has to do
with the pleasure and effectiveness of use. Here both the tilting teapot
and my little metal ball are winners

* Reflective:reflective design considers
the rationalization and intellectualization of a product. Can I tell a story
about it? Does it appeal to my self-image, to my pride?

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:
