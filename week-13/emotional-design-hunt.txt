# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that object’s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-13/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: This laptop has a very nice design with the silver/chrome body and backlight keyboard that makes it astatically pleasing. The laptop comes to life after the power button is illuminated and lights start to appear on the screen.

* Behavioral: The computer is very fast allowing for smooth operations within a performance demanding program. I become frustrated when computers lag when one is trying to work on it so a fast computer is very pleasurable to me. 

* Reflective: Absolutely, this computer appeals to my self-image and pride. After spending several years with the same machine I feel I have made this my own. I still use the computer despite the damage from normal wear and tear. I have a hard time moving from one unit to the next because all of my personal information is on this computer and it has gone almost everywhere with me for the past 3 years. 
 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Past projects that can give me ideas on how to design the site
2. Fast processor to seamlessly design, write, and test the code
3. Familiarity and a level of comfort that produces the best and most ideal working environment
