Craigslist Design 'B'

For this design 'B' of http://chicago.craigslist.org/ I feel like this layout will allow users a less cramped space to find what they are looking for. Users would scroll down through the page instead of having all the information thrown at them in one viewing area. For the HTML I would use flexboxes to organize and structure the page. This would allow for easy content addition. Each section (ie. Community, Discussion, For Sale) could automatically reorder/resize if content is needed to be added. This can all be achieved using flexbox. The CSS needs to be changed a bit just to allow for the full width of each content section. Other than an overhaul to the HTML there is really nothing else that needs to be done. I used the inspect tool within chrome to develop the site for the Photoshop picture I created. Using this tool I edited the HTML to layout the design I desired and kept most of the CSS that was there. I changed the widths in the CSS as mentioned above, to achieve, what I believe, would be a more user friendly layout of the webpage.
